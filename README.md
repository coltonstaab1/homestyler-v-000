<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
  This is a Rails app that helps homeowners furnish their homes and designers share their wares with homeowners.
</p>
<p>
  Homestyler's users can create lists of rooms in their homes that they need to furnish. They can also select furniture from Homestyler's market that they'd like to put in that particular room.  Users can also look at other users' profiles to find design inspiration for their homes.
</p>
<p>
  Designers have all the same features as homeowners, but they also have the ability to add furniture items to Homestyler's furniture list.
